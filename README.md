Voting Counter using multiplexers dual 4x1 74153 

a committee is composed of a chairman (c), a senior member (s), and a member (m). the rules of the committee state that: • the vote of the member (m) will be counted as 2 votes • the vote of the senior member will be counted as 3 votes. • the vote of the chairman will be counted as 5 votes. each of these persons has a switch to close (“l”) when voting yes and to open (“0”) when voting no. it is necessary to design a circuit that displays the total number of votes for each issue. use a seven segment display and a decoder to display the required number. if all members vote no for an issue the display should be blank. (recall from experiment #5, that a binary input 15 into the 7446 blanks all seven segments). if all members vote yes for an issue, the display should be 0. otherwise the display shows a decimal number equal to the number of 'yes' votes. use two 74153 units, which include four multiplexers to design the combinational circuit that converts the inputs from the members’ switch to the bcd digit for the 7446. in proteus use +5v for logic 1 and ground for logic 0 and use switches for c, s,and m. use two chips 74153 and one decoder 7446 verify your design and get a copy of your circuit with the pin numbers to lab so that you could connect the hardware in exactly the same way
